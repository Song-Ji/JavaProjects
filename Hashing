Hashing 

Hash Tables:
A hashing function is a function which assigns an int value, called a hash code,
to each object that is an istance of some class. 

There are many techniques commonly used to make hashing functions from keys, but most are based on some combination of 
extraction, division, and folding.

extraction: this method only uses a certain part of the key for the calculation of hash code.
like using the first letter of the surname : John Lewis , Joseph Chase

division: this method uses the integer remainder operator % to ensure that the hash code is within certain bounds. 

folded: if a key can be broken into parts, then those parts could be folder. For instance, if the key is six digit number, 
then it could be broken into three two digit numbers.

A hash table is a data structure for a set collection where elements are stored in an array at indices 
determined by their hash code. For instance, "cow" ,"fly", "dog" are to be stored in a hash table with 9 buckets, 
using a hashing function which takes the first letter of the string and subtracts off 'a'.  If an element is to be added 
has a hash code larger than the capacity of the hash table.  we need to take the remainder modulo the capacity to obtain
a valid index. 

Overall , hash table provides quite efficent access to elements in collection
O(1) to see if the element is stored at that index, avoiding the need for a linear or binary search
perfect hashing :  as long as the hashing is one-to-one for the elments in the collection.
